# Collection.js <sup>v0.1.0</sup>

Multi-purpose advanced collection class with event handling and validation.

# Why Collection?

Cross-browser development is a nightmare for js programmers sometimes. These days we must rely on the browser to use functions like ```filter```, ```reduce``` or such, and if the browser simply doesn't support them, we must alternatives like [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) or create some functions that adjusts to our needs.

With Collection.js you have a event-handled, sortable, iterable, replicable and easy-to-use class.
